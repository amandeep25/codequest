                <p> 
                 Iron man likes fighting games a lot. He owns a game called "Fight Club". In this game there are n players playing all the times. Every player has a power level (Ai). Every day one of the following 2 things happen:
<br>•	Either one of these players get a power boost of X, now his power level increases by X.
<br>•	Or two players X and Y (with power levels Ax ad Ay) fight against each other and if some player is having power level strictly greater than the other then he gets all the power (Ax+Ay) and the power level of the other player becomes 0. If they have equal energies then it's a draw and nothing happens.

<br>The above game continues for d days. Now you have the information of what happened on each day.
<br>•	1 i X : ith player gets  power of X.
<br>•	2 U V : means the player U and V fight against each other.
<br>After every day you need to print the maximum power level that ay player has (Note that you just need to print power level, player number does not matter here).
<br>Input
<br>First line will contain 2 integers 'n' and 'd', denoting the number of players in the game and number of days for which the game is played respectively.
<br>Next line contains n integers denoting the initial power levels of all the players.
<br>Next d lines contain one of the 2 operations mentioned above.
<br>Output
<br>Contains 'd' lines with each integer(ith) denoting the Maximum power level after the ith day.
<br>Constraints
<br>•	1 <= n,d <= 10^5
<br>•	1 <= Ai <= 10^9
<br>•	1 <= i, U, V <= n
<br>•	1 <= X <= 10^9
  <br>If Input is:
   <br>5 5
                    <br>12 5 2 14 6
                    <br>1 2 5
                    <br>2 1 3
                    <br>1 3 2
                    <br>2 1 5
                    <br>2 4 5
                    <br>     Count duplicate answers only once in all the above outputs, and put them in a set named A.
  <br>What is the sum of all prime factors of the elements in set A?
